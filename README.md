# MH Aid ReadMe

## Project Title
MH Aid is a mobile application that aims to make students' lives easier. It primarily focuses on efficiency, functionality, and practicality. At the moment, information relating to Morris Hills High School can be found, but often requires a lengthy search. As a result, MH Aid aims to compact valuable resources/abilities such as emailing teachers, viewing schedules, and exploring extracurricular activities into one platform.

## Build Status
The primary functionality of MH Aid has already been obtained. All functions branching off of each item on the tool bar view controller serve their required purpose. However, MH Aid is currently undergoing improvements. Without additional sign-in features, it is difficult for MH Aid to create an email draft, as it is difficult to find a sender email. Currently, it uses the email attached to the Apple ID.

## Tech/Framework used
MH Aid was created soley using Xcode. The language chosen was swift and the interface used was storyboard (not swiftUI).

## Features
MH Aid features direct integration with Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, allowing users to keep up to date with the latest news regarding Morris Hills High School activities. MH Aid also features an area where users can input their current schedule, and the app saves this on the back end and displays it on their screen for future reference. MH Aid also links directly to a Google Sites containing information about Morris Hills' extracurricular activities, with an easily understandable and usable user interface. The application has a location where students can view the day's lunch menu; if the user is an administrator with the correct authentication code, they have the ability to edit the day's unique specials. The application also links to a Google Calendar with all of the previous, current, and upcoming events hosted by the Morris Hills Regional District. Finally, MH Aid allows users to contact teachers/staff directly from the app, prompting for a question, sender name, and teacher recipient. Users can also contact the developer through another pre-drafted email as well as view the application's privacy policy and terms and conditions on the same page.

## Installation
Currently, MH Aid is only supported by iOS devices, as it was created using Xcode. Although it is not published on the iOS App Store, users can potentially clone the GitHub source code, download xCode, and utilize the app. This should take no more than an hour.
