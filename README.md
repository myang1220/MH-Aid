# MH Aid ReadMe

## Project Title
MH Aid is a mobile application that aims to make students' lives easier. It primarily focuses on efficiency, functionality, and practicality. At the moment, information relating to Morris Hills High School can be found, but often requires a lengthy search. As a result, MH Aid aims to compact valuable resources/abilities such as emailing teachers, viewing schedules, and exploring extracurricular activities into one platform.

## Build Status
The primary functionality of MH Aid has already been obtained. All functions branching off of each item on the tool bar view controller serve their required purpose. However, MH Aid is currently undergoing improvements. Without additional sign-in features, it is difficult for MH Aid to create an email draft, as it is difficult to find a sender email. Currently, it uses the email attached to the Apple ID.

## Screenshots
As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.

## Tech/Framework used
MH Aid was created soley using Xcode. The language chosen was swift and the interface used was storyboard (not swiftUI).

## Features
MH Aid features direct integration with Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, allowing users to keep up to date with the latest news regarding Morris Hills High School activities. MH Aid also features an area where users can input their current schedule, and the app saves this on the back end and displays it on their screen for future reference. MH Aid also links directly to a Google Sites containing information about Morris Hills' extracurricular activities, with an easily understandable and usable user interface. The application has a location where students can view the day's lunch menu; if the user is an administrator with the correct authentication code, they have the ability to edit the day's unique specials. The application also links to a Google Calendar with all of the previous, current, and upcoming events hosted by the Morris Hills Regional District. Finally, MH Aid allows users to contact teachers/staff directly from the app, prompting for a question, sender name, and teacher recipient. Users can also contact the developer through another pre-drafted email as well as view the application's privacy policy and terms and conditions on the same page.

## Code Examples
This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simply as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.

## Installation
If your project needs installation of certain software or configurations to the system. Do mention it in this section as it helps a lot for the reader to use your project. The steps mentioned should be precise and explanatory.  If possible, you can add links that can help them better understand how to configure/install the necessary files or softwares.

## API reference
If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.

## Tests
This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples

## How to Use?
As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.

## Contribute
This is where you let them know that they can contribute and help you out. A guideline on how to contribute is also helpful
